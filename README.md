# A Simple Parser for Graphviz DOT language

Parse DOT into GraphAST, which can then convert to a graph in the petgraph library.

Still work-in-progress, pull requests are welcomed!

## A few TODOs
- [ ] Handle comments/spaces correctly
- [ ] Support subgraphs and attribute statements
- [ ] Convert node/edge labels into petgraph
- [ ] Support edges with multiple RHS
- [ ] Support node_id with ports
